Hi there!

A new month, a new update!

## PHP 8.2

PHP 8.2's feature freeze is coming in fast: there's only one month and a couple of days [left to go](https://wiki.php.net/todo/php82) until we know the full and final changelog for it. Since my previous mail, we now also know PHP 8.2's release date: **November 24, 2022**.

With PHP 8.2 around the corner, I was inspired to write about a specific topic: how to deal with deprecations? Just like every minor release, PHP 8.2 adds a couple of deprecations here and there. I have a feeling though that people might perceive PHP 8.2 as a more aggressive release when it comes to deprecations. So I thought it would be helpful to share some thoughts about how to deal with them.

These are my four key takeaways:

1. We should understand how deprecations are helpful
2. They can be silenced
3. They are notices, not errors
4. You can deal with them in an automated way

You can read the full post about them here: [https://stitcher.io/blog/dealing-with-deprecations](https://stitcher.io/blog/dealing-with-deprecations).

## PhpStorm

As you know, I started working at JetBrains in the PhpStorm team a couple of months ago. One of the things we've been talking about is how to improve the PhpStorm experience for newcomers. Maybe you just started using PhpStorm, or maybe you've used it in the past and left? We're looking for a people who want to do a one-on-one video call and talk about their experience, so that we can learn and improve. 

> The PhpStorm team is currently looking for PHP developers to participate in user experience interviews.
> 
> Please fill out [this form](https://surveys.jetbrains.com/s3/php-developers-b), and if your profile matches our study criteria you will be redirected to our Calendly sign up page, where you will be offered to pick a convenient time slot for an interview. During the video call we will ask some questions about your development practices, thoughts, and opinions in a moderated, non-intrusive way. The anonymized interview results will greatly help us to improve PhpStorm. As a token of appreciation, we will provide you with a small gift from JetBrains.

## On the vlog

Speaking of PhpStorm, I've just released another vlog! This one is about how I set up PhpStorm in my opinionated way to be clean and minimalistic â€” the way I prefer to write code. I'd appreciate you giving it a look, and maybe also an upvote if you've got the chance? Here you go: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVTk-F3g9XM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jVTk-F3g9XM&).
