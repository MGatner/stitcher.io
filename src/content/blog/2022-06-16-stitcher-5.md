Some exciting news today: Stitcher — this blog — turned 5! In a way, that feels like a long time, although I was also thinking this week: "it feels longer than that". Anyway, it's a reason to celebrate! So first things first: **I'm giving away 5 Stitcher-themed elephpants**, keep on reading if you want one!

Before explaining how you can get an elephpant, let me say how much I appreciate it that you're here. I never imagined my blog to turn out the way it did when I first started it 5 years ago, and that's in large part thanks to you!

So, thank you!

Now, how to get an elephpant: I'm giving them away on Twitter, my newsletter and YouTube. By the time you're reading this, my newsletter is probably already sent, but you can still [follow me on Twitter](https://twitter.com/brendt_gd) and [check out YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/BrenDtRoose) if you want one. 

Here's the YouTube video with more instructions:

Thanks for reading, and thank you for being here!
